# DSA-learning

This repo will be used to log my progress in learning DSA.

### Week 1 (June 17 - June 23): Basic Data Structures

#### Goals:

- Understand and implement basic data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.

#### Daily Plan:

- **Day 1**: Introduction to Arrays. Learn and implement basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal).
- **Day 2**: Linked Lists - Introduction and implementation of singly linked lists.
- **Day 3**: Linked Lists - Doubly linked lists and circular linked lists.
- **Day 4**: Stacks - Concept and implementation (using arrays and linked lists).
- **Day 5**: Queues - Concept and implementation (using arrays and linked lists).
- **Day 6**: Priority Queues and Deques - Implementation and use cases.
- **Day 7**: Review and practice problems on Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues (LeetCode, HackerRank).

### Week 2 (June 24 - June 30): Trees and Graphs

#### Goals:

- Understand and implement basic tree and graph structures.

#### Daily Plan:

- **Day 1**: Introduction to Trees. Binary Trees - implementation and basic operations.
- **Day 2**: Binary Search Trees (BST) - Concept, insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Day 3**: AVL Trees and Balanced Trees - Concept and implementation.
- **Day 4**: Introduction to Graphs - Representation (adjacency list, adjacency matrix).
- **Day 5**: Graph Traversal Algorithms - Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- **Day 6**: Minimum Spanning Trees (Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms).
- **Day 7**: Review and practice problems on Trees and Graphs (LeetCode, HackerRank).

### Week 3 (July 1 - July 7): Sorting and Searching Algorithms

#### Goals:

- Understand and implement basic sorting and searching algorithms.

#### Daily Plan:

- **Day 1**: Introduction to Sorting Algorithms - Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort.
- **Day 2**: Merge Sort - Concept and implementation.
- **Day 3**: Quick Sort - Concept and implementation.
- **Day 4**: Heap Sort - Concept and implementation.
- **Day 5**: Introduction to Searching Algorithms - Linear search and Binary search.

- **Day 7**: Review and practice sorting and searching problems (LeetCode, HackerRank).

### Week 4 (July 8 - July 15): Advanced Topics and Problem Solving

#### Goals:

- Study advanced data structures and algorithms, and focus on problem-solving.

#### Daily Plan:

- **Day 1**: Hash Tables - Concept, collision resolution techniques, and implementation.
- **Day 2**: Heaps and Priority Queues - Concept and implementation.
- **Day 3**: Tries - Concept and implementation for string operations.
- **Day 4**: Recursion - Understanding and practicing recursion-based problems.
- **Day 5**: Dynamic Programming - Introduction and basic problems.
- **Day 6**: Greedy Algorithms - Concept and common problems.
- **Day 7**: Review, practice, and solve advanced problems (LeetCode, HackerRank).

### General Tips:

- **Daily Practice**: Spend at least 2 hours daily coding and solving problems.
- **Weekly Review**: At the end of each week, review what you've learned and identify any weak areas.
- **Mock Interviews**: Conduct mock interviews with friends or use platforms like Pramp to simulate real interview scenarios.
- **Stay Consistent**: Consistency is key. Stick to the plan and adjust only if necessary.
